Module 2 Required Coding Activity
Introduction to Python Unit 1

This is an activity based on code similar to the Jupyter Notebook Practice_MOD02_1-3_IntroPy.ipynb which you may have completed.

Some Assignment Requirements
NOTE: This program requires a function be defined, created and called. The call will send values based on user input. The function call must capture a return value that is used in print output. The function will have parameters and return a string and should otherwise use code syntax covered in module 2.
Program: fishstore()
create and test fishstore()

fishstore() takes 2 string arguments: fish & price
fishstore returns a string in sentence form
gather input for fish_entry and price_entry to use in calling fishstore()
print the return value of fishstore()
example of output: Fish Type: Guppy costs $1
'''

# [ ] create, call and test fishstore() function 
# then PASTE THIS CODE into edX

def fish_store(fish, price):
    print("Fish type: " + fish + " costs $" + price)

fish_entry = input("What fish? ")
price_entry = input("What price (In $)? ")

fish_store(fish_entry, price_entry)
