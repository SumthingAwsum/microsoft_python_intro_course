'''
Module 3 Required Coding Activity
Introduction to Python Unit 1

This is an activity based on code similar to the Jupyter Notebook Practice_MOD03_1-4_IntroPy.ipynb and Practice_MOD03_1-5_IntroPy.ipynb which you may have completed as practice.

NOTE: This program requires the use of if, elif, else, and casting between strings and numbers. The program should use the various code syntax covered in module 3.

The program must result in print output using numeric input similar to that shown in the sample below.

Program: Cheese Order
set values for maximum and minimum order variables
set value for price variable
get order_amount input and cast to a number
check order_amount and give message checking against
over maximum
under minimum
else within maximum and minimum give message with calculated price
Sample input and output:

Enter cheese order weight (numeric value): 113
113.0 is more than currently available stock
Enter cheese order weight (numeric value): .15
0.15 is below minimum order amount
Enter cheese order weight (numeric value): 2
2.0 costs $15.98
'''

# [ ] create, call and test 
# then PASTE THIS CODE into edX

maximum = 100
minimum = 90
price = 5
order_amount = int(input("Amount? "))

if order_amount > maximum:
    print("TOO MUCH! ")
elif order_amount < minimum:
    print("NOT ENOUGH! ")
else:
    print("Please pay $" + str(price * order_amount) + " for " + str(order_amount) + " things.")
