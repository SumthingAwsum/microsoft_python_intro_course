# microsoft_python_intro_course
The final projects for Microsoft's intro course.

The files in this project are from Microsoft's "Introduction to Python: Absolute Beginner" course I found through edX

Files contain the original instructions and my code below. 
File names are from the Jupyter notebook names taken from the course. 
This course was free, and I did not choose to pay for the certification. However, all my work is of my own, and the code works :)

This is my first project. If you have comments or feedback, please let me know. Thanks!
