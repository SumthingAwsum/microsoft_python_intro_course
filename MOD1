Module 1 Required Coding Activity
Introduction to Python Unit 1

This is an activity from the Jupyter Notebook Practice_MOD01_1-2_IntroPy.ipynb which you may have already completed.

NOTE: This program requires print output and code syntax used in module 1

Some Assignment Requirements
NOTE: This program requires print output and using code syntax used in module 1 such as variable assignment, input, in keyword, .lower() or .upper() method
Program: Allergy Check
[ ] get user input for categories of food eaten in the last 24 hours
save in a variable called input_test
example input01 02 practice Allergy-input 
[ ] print True if "dairy" is in the input_test string
[ ] Test the code so far
 
[ ] modify the print statement to output similar to below
example output01 02 Allergy output
Test the code so far trying input including the string "dairy" and without
 

[ ] repeat the process checking the input for "nuts", challenge add "Seafood" and "chocolate"
[ ] Test your code
 

[ ] challenge: make your code work for input regardless of case, e.g. - print True for "Nuts", "NuTs", "NUTS" or "nuts"

'''

# Create Allergy check code
# then PASTE THIS CODE into edX

# [ ] get input for input_test variable
input_test = input("What have you eaten in the past 24 hours? ")

# [ ] print "True" message if "dairy" is in the input or False message if not
if "dairy" in input_test.lower():
    print("True")
else:
    print("False")

# [ ] print True message if "nuts" is in the input or False if not
if "nuts" in input_test.lower():
    print("True")
else:
    print("False")

# [ ] Challenge: Check if "seafood" is in the input - print message
if "dairy" in input_test.lower():
    print("Dairy is in", input_test)
else:
    print("Dairy is not in", input_test)

# [ ] Challenge: Check if "chocolate" is in the input - print message
if "chocolate" in input_test.lower():
    print("Chocolate is in", input_test)
else:
    print("chocolate is not in", input_test)
